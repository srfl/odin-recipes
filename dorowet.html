  <h2>dorowet recipes</h2>
  <p>This dish is meant to be one component of a larger Ethiopian meal. Serve with the Braised Cabbage, Carrots and Potatoes, Red Lentils (Misr Wat), Braised Beef with Peppers (Zilzil Tibs) and Quick Injera, layering the injera on a platter and mounding a portion of each dish on top. Tear off pieces of the injera to use as a "utensil" for scooping up bites of each. </p>
