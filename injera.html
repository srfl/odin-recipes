  <h2>injera recipes</h2>
  <p>Injera is a spongy, slightly sour flatbread from Ethiopia and Eritrea, considered to be the national dish of these two countries.</p>
  
  <h2>ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>teff flour (or some plain flour or rice flour)</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>vegetable oil or ghee for cooking</li>
  
  </ul>
  <h2>steps</h2>
  <ol>
  
    <li>Put the teff flour in the bottom of a mixing bowl, and sift in the  all-purpose flour. </li>
    <li>Slowly add the water, stirring to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Put the batter aside for a day or more (up to three days) to allow it to ferment. In this time, your injera batter will start to bubble and acquire the slight tanginess for which it\u2019s known. Note: If you find that your injera batter does not ferment on its own, try adding a teaspoon of yeast. </li>
    <li>Stir in the salt. </li>
    <li>Heat a nonstick pan or lightly oiled cast-iron skillet until a water
drop dances on the surface. Make sure the surface of the pan is smooth: Otherwise, your injera might fall apart when you try to remove it. </li>
    <li>Coat the pan with a thin layer of batter. Injera should be thicker than a crêpe, but not as thick as a traditional pancake. It will rise slightly when it heats.</li>
    <li>Cook until holes appear on the surface of the bread. Once the surface is dry, remove the bread from the pan and let it cool.</li>
    
       
  
  </ol>
